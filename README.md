# 🔐 Company

USDW token is a stable digital currency operated by Dwin Intertrade Company Limited. The main idea is 1 USDW = 1 USD, all assets will be collateralized in Dollar by Investment Bank, Malaysia, which must report to the relevant authorities every week. This means that the account will be audited by financial auditors every week. Therefore, USDW users can trust and believe that USDW is a truly stable digital currency for exchange according to the purpose of creating the token

# US Dollar Guaranteed
The USDW token is supported by assets from private ledger accounts, allowing transactions in various familiar and less volatile currencies. To ensure accountability and price stability, We propose maintaining a one-to-one reserve ratio, where one (1$) USD is equivalent to one (1$) USDW token. This ratio is supported by real-world assets, with other currencies being exchanged for USD to back the USDW token, thereby stabilizing its exchange price.
